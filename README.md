In this project let's build a Insta Share App by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using component lifecycle methods, routing concepts, authentication, and authorization, and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own.

Project Submission Instructions
For Mini Projects, you can submit the test cases at your own pace. But we suggest you to submit the code to know the percentage of completion through test cases and that score will be considered for your interviews

Also it's important to publish your code frequently using Step - 4 in the Instructions tab

Things to Keep in Mind
All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.
Do not remove the pre-filled code
